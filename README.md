2. Data on Your Device and iCloud
Any data you create in the App is saved directly on your device. If you choose to back it up using iCloud, that data is managed by Apple under your iCloud account. We don’t have access to it. You’re responsible for securing your device and iCloud account. Check Apple’s Privacy Policy for details about iCloud.

4. No Third Parties
The App doesn’t share your data with anyone, except for iCloud if you enable it. We don’t use analytics or tracking tools.

5. Kids’ Privacy
The App isn’t meant for children under 13. We don’t collect data from anyone, including kids.
